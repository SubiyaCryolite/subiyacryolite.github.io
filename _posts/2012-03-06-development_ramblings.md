Ever since the game made drastic changes in the transition from version 1.7 to 1.8 a whole load of bugs have popped up.

Oh well, this is to be expected as a lot of edits and refactoring took place on code that was over 2 years old in some places.

I've spent the last week doing extensive tests to discover and eliminate as much of them as possible. 
Having a dedicated Q&A team would be so awesome right now.

Rest assured, I'm working hard on making patch 1.8c as stable as good old version 1.7 and those that came before.
