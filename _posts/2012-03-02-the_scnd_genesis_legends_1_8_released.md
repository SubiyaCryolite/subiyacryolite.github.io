Hello everybody. Iâ€™m pleased to announce that The SCND Genesis: Legends version 1.8 has been released.
It has many new features, fixes and improvements. 

These fixes address all of the issues addressed in the [review](https://subiyacryolite.github.io/2012/2/28/the_scnd_genesis_legends_1_7_reviewed.html) of version 1.7.

Here are all the fixes:
- A new game-play tutorial.
- Significant UI changes.
- Consistent menu layouts and transitions.
- 3 new battle arena variations
- Better multi-lingual support, aid to XML translators
- New Music and Sound effects
- New story mode stage, with a brutal Boss Fight
- Bug fixes
- New modular release structure (small updates as opposed to 100+ MB downloads).
