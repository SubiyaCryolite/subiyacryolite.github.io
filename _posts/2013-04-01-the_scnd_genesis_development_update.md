Hi guys, I’m back from outer space. So much has happened since my last blog post. I’ve co-founded a new promising company 
with some very talented guys, I got formal employment, I trashed my mum’s car, and you know the usual stuff.

Development on Legacy has been extremely slow. Truth is I’ve been distracted by so many things, and also seemed to lack 
motivation as well as creative drive. It sucks; I had more or less been in limbo for the last three to four months.

Thankfully, the Dark Age is over. I’m finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel, and that light is a little green Android. 
I’ve always considered the Second Genesis (SG) franchise as a pick up and play kind of game, suited for short burst of 
play before returning to more important matters. I doubt many people would go ballistic and try to complete the story mode, 
unlock its achievements and master all its characters in one sitting. It is under this context, that I’ve always felt 
handheld would be the best place for this title. Of course the DS, 3DS, PSP and the PS Vita were simply out of the question. 
The type of tablets and phones on the market at the time I completed Legends and started working on Legacy simply lacked 
that extra oomph needed to handle an SG game in a way I would find suitable.

That’s changed now, since the release of Android 4 a few years ago, tablets and phones have now become a viable home for 
the SG family. I’m pleased to announce that SG Legends, which was under development for PC is now coming exclusively to 
Android (3.0+) and who knows, maybe even Ouya.

The gameplay and interface will be optimized for portable gaming and the custom Jenesis Engine 3.0 is being designed to 
scale across multiple devices. No word on an official release date. The games official site and artwork will be published soon.

Thanks and have a blast!
