I'm pleased to announce that the game got its first official review.
It comes courtesy of [IndieGraph](http://indiegraph.wordpress.com).
They don't use a numerical rating policy like [Eurogamer](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-eurogamer-scoring-policy) or IGN but the review itself seemed fairly positive.
All of the issues raised in the review will be addressed in upcoming version 1.8

>I think the game is worth a try although you may or may not like it, depending on your tastes. I thought it was pretty good....
>
>The controls are quite simple and help ease the beginner in, which kind of counters the lack of a tutorial. The graphics are crisp yet cartoony and have a neat hand drawn feel to them. The HUD is nice and stylish but functional....
>
>The main annoyance with the sound has to be the fact that the sound effects are quite repetitive â€“ I swear there is like four or five sound effects used in the game.
